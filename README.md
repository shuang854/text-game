- Make selling/buying engine
- Make combat engine
- Make way to change theme of window (and to save it with your browser)
- Make Locations show doors (conditional upon the player having discovered them)
- Make the location tell you what direction you came from
- Make each item talk about itself if it's in the area (something if you know it's new or if you've seen it before)
- Make the location descriptions different for new vs. visited as well.
